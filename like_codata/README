The intent here is to construct a set of shared routines which define constants or compute universal variables (like the earth's tilt, say) such that all earth system models may use the same value. 

It's also the case that different components may have different requirements for accuracy on, again, say the earth's tilt. Over a few days, this doesn't change much. But in getting to climate time scales, the Milankovitch cycles become important. In analogue to the real_kind(7,250) request, then, such variables/functions have an option to specify needed precision.
